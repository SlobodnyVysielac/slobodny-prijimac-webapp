        - The first number, in our case 254, is the number of current listeners.
        - The second number is the stream status. It is 1 when a source is connected and 0 when there is no source. If there is no source then no client connections occur.
        - The third number, in our case 576, is the maximum number of listeners happened for this stream.
        - The next number (3000) is the maximum number of client connections allowed in total o the server.
        - The fifth number (252) represents the unique client connections across all active streams so if one client is on 2 streams, this will only be counted as one unique client.
        - The sixth number (128) is the current bitrate and,
        - at the end, is the current songâ€™s artist-title.
